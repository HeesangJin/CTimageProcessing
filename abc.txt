Dear Prof. Shuang,

Hello professor,

I have questions in your reply.

1. Does the center value of a pixel mean the pixel's coordinate value?
2. So, in the paper, d is the direction at location p,
???Then p is the center value of the pixel and d is taken from a small volume around the origin. Is this interpretation correct?
3. Do we have to express direction d as coordinate value? For example (1,1) in this way..?

I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best, 
Hyeryong.
